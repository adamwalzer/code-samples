				<li>Gottanom uses PII to create users&apos; Gottanom accounts, to communicate with users (directly and through restaurants and delivery drivers) about Gottanom services, to offer users additional services, promotions and special offers and to charge for purchases and gratuities made through Gottanom. Users may opt to allow Gottanom to store certain PII used to create users&apos; Gottanom accounts, including, but not limited to, credit card information. Gottanom uses certain stored PII to customize future order processing for you.

Gottanom may also use PII to enforce Gottanom terms of use and service.</li>
				<li>Gottanom uses cookies to remember users on the Sites and to enhance users&apos; experience on the Sites. For example, when users with Gottanom accounts return to the Sites, cookies identify those users and allow the Sites to provide certain user-specific information such as Gottanom account information, past orders, favorite restaurants and user restaurant reviews.  Gottanom does not sell the information it collects through the Services to third parties. Gottanom shares collected PII to third-party vendors and service providers with whom Gottanom works to provide application programming interfaces ("APIs") and other functions for the Services in connection with the delivery of Gottanom services.
