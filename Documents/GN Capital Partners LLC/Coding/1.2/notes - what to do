Adam's Report

I have…
	1. Finished up the menu edit page for now
		i. Made the side menus not scroll
		ii. made the edit menu page it's separate page.
		A. Still need to…
			iii. add a 'do you want to leave?' popup on navaway
			iv. re design the edit menu to be more clear to users
	2. Added restaurant edit info page
		i. worked on designing hours input
			A. Still need to code
	3. I think I'm going to take the strategy of just developing for now and going back to design later. Trying to design things on my own and also develop them has definitely slowed down my production.		

I will…

	2. Add Timely Suggestions
		i.	Late night studying		ii.	Up late partying		iii.	Hangover food		iv.	Snack between classes		v.	Do we allow the restaurants to place themselves?
